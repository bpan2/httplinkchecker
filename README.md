# httplinkchecker
Written in java, httplinkchecker is used to check if HTTP links are broken or not

##  0. CLI Usage on Windows 10 system:

	Syntax: 
		$java -jar httplinkchecker.jar -r/v/help arg-1 arg-2 ...

	Note: 
		1. the tool, named as httplinkchecker, is an executable jar file in java.
			Before using it, on Windows 10's cmd.exe, issue the following command:
				javac
			to check if your machine has installed jdk 
		2. the CLI arguments are separated by one space keystroke;
	  	3. arg-1 and arg-2, etc can be 
			either a directory/folder path 
			or a file name with a regular file extension(such as txt, html) in the current directory/folder
			or both.
		4. the options of this tool ALWAYS starts with a single '-'.
		   So far, the options programmed are: 
			1. -r: recursively read all existing sub-directories/folders for regular files
			2. -v: version information
			3. -h/help: for information about the tool as well as instructions on how to use the tool

##  1. Design Considerations:
	1.1 Objects to be used:
		1.1.1. ArgParser: 
			parsing all the user input via CLI arguments
			generating the corresponding absolute paths for the files to be processed by LinkRetriever

			public interfaces: only getter methods
			
		1.1.2. LinkRetriever:
			based on the absolute paths generated by the ArgParser, search the corresponding files for legal http/s links

			  
		1.1.3. LinkValidator

		1.1.4. LinkStatus

		1.1.5. Message

##  2. Implementation Considertations:
		2.1 LinkRetriever: 1. Performance is a key factor to be considered 
					when the number of files to be searched and the size of a file to be searched 
					are signficant enough to impact the performance of this tool. 
				   2. Multithreading is considered. 
				   3. SeekableByteChannel and ByteBuffer.allocateDirect are considered based on the suggestions from
					https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14037404/java-read-large-text-file-with-70million-line-of-text 

		2.2 LinkValidator: 1. Performance becomes significant when sending out HTTP requests and waiting for responses.
				   2. Mutlithreading is considered via java's ExecutorService to manage multithreading.
		 
		2.3 Singleton pattern is used for utility classes: LinkStatus and Message				 

##   3. Known issues
	3.1 jdk version conflicts between the version installed on Windows 10 and the version used by Eclipse(2020-09)
